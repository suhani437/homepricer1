## 🗂️ Dataset and Data Sources

The accuracy and reliability of a machine learning model are highly dependent on the quality and richness of the dataset. For HomePricer, the dataset was curated by aggregating data from multiple trustworthy real estate databases.

### 📊 Key Dataset Features:
- **Historical Home Sales:** Past selling prices
- **Property Features:** Area (sq. ft.), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities
- **Geographical Info:** Neighborhood profiles, proximity to schools, transport, etc.
- **Market Indicators:** Real estate trends, economic conditions, inflation

The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure normalization for optimal model performance.
