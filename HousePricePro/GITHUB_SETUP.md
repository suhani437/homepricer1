# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Follow these steps to upload your HomePricer project to GitHub.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub.com**
2. **Click the "+" icon** (top right) → "New repository"
3. **Fill in details:**
   - Repository name: `homepricer`
   - Description: "ML-powered house price prediction app - BCA F1 academic project"
   - Make it **Public** (so professors can view)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Prepare Your Files

Your project should include these files (already created):

```
homepricer/
├── README.md                 ✅ Project documentation
├── DEPLOYMENT.md            ✅ Deployment instructions  
├── .gitignore              ✅ Files to exclude
├── package.json            ✅ Dependencies
├── client/                 ✅ React frontend
├── server/                 ✅ Express backend + ML model
├── shared/                 ✅ Shared types
└── Other config files      ✅ Vite, Tailwind, etc.
```

## Step 3: Upload to GitHub

### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Download your project** from Replit:
   - Click "Download as ZIP" 
   - Extract the ZIP file on your computer

2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to your new repository page
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag all project files into the upload area
   - Write commit message: "Initial commit: HomePricer ML house prediction app"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option B: Using Git Commands (If Git is installed)

1. **Clone your empty repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/homepricer.git
   cd homepricer
   ```

2. **Copy your project files** into this folder

3. **Add and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: HomePricer ML house prediction app"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

Check that your repository contains:
- ✅ README.md with project description
- ✅ All source code files
- ✅ Documentation files
- ✅ No node_modules or unnecessary files

## Step 5: Make it Professional

### Add Repository Topics:
Go to repository → Settings → General → Topics
Add: `machine-learning`, `react`, `nodejs`, `python`, `house-prices`, `academic-project`

### Create Releases:
1. Go to "Releases" → "Create a new release"
2. Tag: `v1.0.0`
3. Title: "HomePricer v1.0 - Initial Release"
4. Description: "First version of our ML house price prediction app for BCA F1 academic project"

## Step 6: Share Links

Your project will be available at:
- **Repository:** `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/homepricer`
- **Live Demo:** Deploy using DEPLOYMENT.md guide

## Tips for Academic Submission

1. **Add to your resume/portfolio**
2. **Share with professors** for code review
3. **Include in project reports** with GitHub link
4. **Document team contributions** in README
5. **Keep repository public** for visibility

## Troubleshooting

**File too large error:**
- Remove node_modules folder
- Check .gitignore is working

**Upload fails:**
- Try smaller batches of files
- Use Git commands instead

**Missing files:**
- Ensure all important files are included
- Check .gitignore isn't excluding needed files
